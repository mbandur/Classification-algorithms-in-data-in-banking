# Classification algorithms in data in banking
## Information about this project
The goal of this project is to choose the best a machine learning classification algorithm in order to predict whether the client will subscribe a term deposit.
## Domain information about the data
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls.
For most of the cases, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
