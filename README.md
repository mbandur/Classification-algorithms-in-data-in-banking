# Classification algorithms in data in banking
This is my final project for 7 months Sages Kodo≈Çamacz Data Science Bootcamp, which I was participating from November 2019 till May 2020.
## Information about this project
The goal of this project is to overview and comparison machine learning classification algorithms in order to predict whether the client will subscribe a term deposit.
## Domain information about the data
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls.
For most of the cases, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

## Scope of work
1) Exploratory Data Analysis
2) Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning
3) Preparing features into suitable form for modeling
4) Modeling - selection of the best models with default settings
5) Modeling - selection of the best models with class weights
6) Modeling - selection of the best models with grid search
7) Final overview and comparison of all models results
